/-! # Veil

Veil is a _foundational_ framework for (1) specifying, (2)
implementing, (3) testing, and (4) proving safety (and, in the future,
liveness) properties of state transition systems, with a focus on
distributed protocols.

Veil is embedded in the Lean 4 proof assistant and provides push-button
verification for transition systems and their properties expressed
decidable fragments of first-order logic, with the full power of a
modern higher-order proof assistant available when automation falls
short.

This file serves as the root of the `Veil` library. It provides
definitions, options, and attributes that are used throughout the
framework.

/-! ## Options -/

/-- We support two styles of verification condition generation:
  - `wp`, which is what Ivy does
  - `transition`, which is what mypyvy does

  The `transition` style is more general, but `wp` generates smaller, usually
  better queries.

/-! ## `simp` attributes

We have a large number of `simp` attributes in Veil, since we want
precise control over what gets simplified when. Moreover, we want to
keep simplification times low, so we purposefully keep our lemma sets
small.

We use these attributes to control simplification in our DSL constructs
(e.g. `action`) and in the verification conditions (VCs) we generate.
-/

/-! ### General -/

/-- Simplifiers to prepare a goal for SMT. See `SMT/Preparation.lean`.
This is designed to be a "cheap" lemma set, that can be quickly
applied. -/
register_simp_attr smtSimp

/-- Simplifiers to get rid of trivial if conditions. We need these to
simplify `Wp` goals. -/
register_simp_attr ifSimp

/-- We specifically identify lemmas for quantifier elimination and
hoisting, since we run these in a loop and `logicSimp` is too
large/expensive a set to run in a loop. See `SMT/Preparation.lean` -/
register_simp_attr quantifierSimp

/-- Simplifiers to perform logic-based simplification. This mostly
corresponds to Lean's default `simp` set, but with some lemmas that
change quantifier structure removed. (We remove these lemmas because we
need to be careful to preserve decidability of our queries, and
changing the quantifier structure is a sure-fire way of losing
decidability, even if the obtained goals are logically equivalent.) -/

them into their components named invariants. -/

invariant clauses, to unfold them. -/
