/-- `require P` means that execution can only proceed if `P` holds. It
is used to express pre-conditions.

When an action including `require` is called by the environment, this
behaves like an `assume`. When it is called by another action, this
behaves like an `assert`: the caller must ensure that `P` holds.

If you have inconsistent `require` statements, your action will not
admit any executions. -/

this statement. If `P` does not hold, this execution fails. -/

/-- `assume P` ignores executions that do not satisfy `P`. BE CAREFUL
when making assumptions, as inconsistent assumptions will eliminate ALL
executions, making your specification vacuous. -/

/-- `pick` creates a non-deterministic, arbitrary value of the given
type `ty`, which is optional. If no type is provided, it is inferred.

We recommend giving type annotations when possible, e.g. `pick Nat`,
as type inference failures might lead to confusing error messages. -/
