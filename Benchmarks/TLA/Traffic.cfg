SPECIFICATION Spec

\* Check that eventually all processes terminate
\* Note: Termination requires fairness, but Spec doesn't include it.
\* The algorithm uses "fair process" and "fair+ process",
\* so we need a fairness-enhanced spec for liveness checking.

\* For safety checking only:
CHECK_DEADLOCK FALSE

\* Uncomment to check termination (requires adding fairness to Spec):
\* PROPERTY Termination
