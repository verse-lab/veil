  NOTE: For now we do not prove the liveness property of SCP in Veil, so
  there are some notable differences between the Veil spec and the Ivy spec:
  - The `node` type is declared to be `finite` in the Ivy spec as required
    by the liveness proof, but we do not require it in Veil.
  - Some assumptions (`qi_intact`, `slice_blocks_ne` and `intact_is_quorum`)
    in the Ivy spec are only needed for the liveness proof and are not included
    in the Veil spec.

/- NOTE: In `SCP.ivy`, `ballot` is modelled as an unbounded sequence,
   but neither `next` nor `prev` appears in the protocol or any invariant.
   So here we model `ballot` as simply a `TotalOrderWithMinimum`. -/
